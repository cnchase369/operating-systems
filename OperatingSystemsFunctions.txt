The textbook talks about several system functions related to all computers. Systems functions include but are not limited to starting/ shutting down, providing a user interface, managing programs/ memory/ tasks. According to the book starting sends an electrical current to circuitry. The charge of electricity causes the processor to reset itself, then finds the firmware containing start up instructions. A a series of tests to check attached components. The kernel of OS is loaded from internal storage to RAM. The OS takes control and loads system configuration information. 
We interact with an operating system through the user interface; this is what controls how we enter data and instructions. There are two types of user interface one is the command line the other is graphical in nature. Most of us today use a graphical interface for ease and convenience. The command line interface can give more control however it does require exact spelling and punctuation 
Shutting down can be configured manually and is different from sleep mode or hibernation mode where the terminal can more quickly load data however unsaved work is volatile and liable to be lost in the case of a loss of power. You can set the power button to automatically save data and force a person to shut down through the UI for example if you have physical security concerns. This works in the reverse order of starting a system and removes the power flow through the terminal to cease operations.
